# PulseHome
PulseHome is a modular Rust-based smart home controller demonstrating real-world use of the Observer and Mediator design patterns. It lets users interact via CLI to add and control devices like lights, thermostats, and locks while observers handle console updates and event logging, all built with TDD principles.
